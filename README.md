# GoldenLuckyCat
A lucky cat that moves its arm with various prompts.

I'm an artist and I am teaching a class on code-based art projects. I wanted to make something that's impractical but funny, and that teaches a lot of different skills at once.

The hardware for this cat uses a simple combination of a servo motor and an arduino. The code is also simple! Software platform is a combines Processing and Arduino. In its first version, the cat moves its arm with a click of the mouse. In V2, the cat responds to a tweet. 

Thanks for checking out the project. Full hardware assembly instructions are available via Instructables.
